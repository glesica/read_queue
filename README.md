# Read Queue

A Chrome extension that allows the user to maintain a queue of pages or
articles to read in the future.

## Development

The extension is written in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/). Assuming
a working Dart setup, `pub get` will get the dependencies and
`pub build extension` will build the extension. Compiled output
will end up in `build/extension/`.
